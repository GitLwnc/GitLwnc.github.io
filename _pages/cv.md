Development of algorithm and system for risk and soil type identifications in real-time in autonomous excavators (Sep. 2020 ~ Dec. 2020).
------
Developing an autonomous excavator is cruial for excavation in high-risk construction environments such as the deep ocean and exo-planets, yet it faces two challenges: 1) detecting excavation risk in real time, e.g., detecting unexpected hard rock and existing underground constractions; and 2) detecting soil types during excavation in real time for automatically adjusting excavation strategy. To solve these problems, this work developed a new real-time algorithm based on both time- and frequency- domain analyses of acceleration signals. Moreover, excavation experiment was conducted to determine the appropriate position of acceleration sensors and the hyperparameters of the proposed algorithm.
* Granted patent: Zhang, **Yang**, et al. CN113065388B, 2022-11-01.

A series of oedometer tests were conducted to investigate the evolution of stress, stiffness, and fabric anisotropy in sands subjected to loading stresses up to 3.0 MPa. It is achieved by monitoring changes in stress and small-strain shear stiffness ratios, using a modified oedometer equipped with bender elements. A total of 36 samples, comprising three types of sand with varying particle strength, were prepared at initial relative densities of 24% and 60%. Each sample was tested in a single loading-unloading cycle, and the maximum stress covers six levels from 0.5 MPa to 3.0 MPa.

I am now a 3-th year Ph. D candidate in the College of Civil Engineering at Hunan University, supervised by supervised by [Prof. Chao Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chao-Zhang-43). I joined Prof. Zhang's [UNSAT lab](https://chaozhanghnu.github.io/team/) in 2020 as a 3-rd year undergraduate student and completed my bachelor's degree in 2021 at the same institution. 

My recent research passion lies in understanding **the underlying physics of desiccation cracking in porous media** (particularly in soils), which is a ubiquitous phenomenon in both nature and industry. It is a highly non-linear process, involving multi-physics processes such as evaporation, two-phase flow of vapor and water, heat transfer, and build-up of stress due to both the capillary pressure and the adsorption between nano-particles. With such complex processes:

* _How can we accurately predict the initiation of desiccation cracks?_ 

* _What is the key mechanism governing the fascinating self-organized pattern of desiccation cracks?_ 

* _Can we manipulate the propagation of desiccation cracks to create specific patterns on micro and nano scales?_ 

I try to integral cutting-edge insights from **optical experimental techniques** (e.g., digital image correlation, micron CT, high-speed photography, etc.) **elastic-plastic fracture mechanics**, **phase transition theory in statistic physics**, and **fractal theory** to explore the physics of crack initiation and propagation, as well as the key underlying mechanism and statistic properties of desiccation crack pattern. 

In UNSAT lab, I belong to a six-member group focusing on stress state and constitutive relation for unsaturated soil. I assisted Prof. Zhang in managing this group and worked closely with the other five members. I deeply participate in the research of the other five members, e.g., clay pore structure evolution via small-angle neutron scattering and small-angle scattering X-ray scattering, robot development for swimming in granular environments, deep-buried soil's anisotropies in fabric, stress and modulus, loading collapse phenomenon in high-expansive clay, etc.
